Why learn about data structures and algorithms?

The reality is, the more you learn about data structures and algorithms, the better a programmer you become.

Why?

Because, data structures and algorithms are effectively patterns for solving problems.   You want to add as many of them as you can to your skill-set.  By doing so, you will find you solve more problems, and use the right tools for the job, in a more elegant way.  And you will learn a heap of them in this course.
